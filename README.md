# C++ project: Black Jack
Develop one of the following projects in C++:
- [ ] Simulation of the Briscola game (player1 against player2)
- [ ] Simulation of a card game of your choice (player versus computer)
- [ ] Simulation of the Briscola game (player against computer)
- [x] Simulation of a card game of your choice (player versus computer and player1 versus player2)

# Rules
The project must be developed and submitted following these guidelines.

## Development methods
The project can be carried out individually or in pairs, according to these methods:
- An individual project can be chosen from any of the four typologies
- A paired project can only be chosen between types 3 and 4
- It must contain at least one abstract class and be implemented using dynamic arrays, allocated in heap memory through the use of appropriate pointers.
- Must be implemented according to software engineering rules

## Submitting the project
Everything shown here must be submitted:
- The commented sources
- The technical analysis, with the UML of the classes involved and their relationships, the description of attributes and methods, the explanation of the algorithms used to implement the game logic
- The detailed rules of the chosen game
- A document with a breakdown of the working times and the subdivision of the work, if the project is carried out in pairs.
